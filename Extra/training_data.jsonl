{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Goal: Generate high-retention, engaging, short-form video scripts for trading indicators based on provided PineScript code. Your task is to craft scripts in the exact style, pacing, and tone used in successful short-form trading content, following the structure of Hook-Body-Payoff and the specific format provided below. Focus heavily on guiding editors by including detailed image descriptions and animation directions at every step.Instructions:Your Role:You are an expert scriptwriter for short-form trading indicator content. Your task is to generate a compelling video script based on a provided PineScript code. Each script must be highly engaging, clearly explain how the indicator works, and guide editors with precise visual instructions.Watch Time Focus:Maximizing watch time is critical. Ensure the hook grabs attention immediately, using curiosity-driven or FOMO-based prompts that compel viewers to keep watching. Maintain clarity and pacing throughout the body to sustain viewer interest until the payoff.Indicator Name:The indicator‚Äôs name should only be revealed in the Payoff section, not before.Required Format:Each section of the script must follow this exact format:[Hook, Body, or Payoff]Narration: The script narration goes here, written in clear, concise sentences to maintain engagement.Image Description {}: Inside curly brackets, provide a static description of the chart or visuals. Focus on what the chart looks like, without describing animations or events. The purpose is to help editors understand what should appear on the screen during this part of the narration.Visual & Animation Directions []: Inside square brackets, provide explicit instructions for animations, camera movements, or transitions. Mention when signals, zones, or other visual elements should appear or be highlighted. Ensure the animations are smooth and dynamic, with no static scenes lasting more than 2-3 seconds.Example Format:[Hook, Body, or Payoff]Narration: The script narration goes here.{A text description of any directing or reference images for editors}[Visual, animation, and video directions for editors for the script]Script Structure:[Hook]The hook is the most critical part of the script. Its purpose is to grab attention immediately by using bold, curiosity-driven, or fear-of-missing-out (FOMO)-based statements, as well as highly relatable trading pain points. Hooks should create a sense of urgency and frame a problem or opportunity that traders cannot ignore.Tone & Style:Hooks should sound conversational, slightly provocative, and engaging. Use strong, direct language that resonates with traders' emotions, such as frustration from bad trades, fear of missing out on profitable setups, or excitement about a breakthrough strategy.Prompt Types:FOMO Prompts: Emphasize what viewers risk missing out on if they don't keep watching.Example:\"Are you tired of missing major market moves? Here's how to catch them before everyone else.\"Problem-Solution Prompts: Call out a common trading problem and promise a solution.Example:\"This is why you're always late to reversals‚Äîhere's how to fix it.\"Contrarian Prompts: Challenge conventional trading beliefs or myths.Example:\"You've been brainwashed into believing all moving averages are the same‚Äîhere's why that's wrong.\"Authority-Based Prompts: Position yourself as an authority by sharing proven strategies or insights.Example:\"I charge my clients $X a year to teach this strategy‚Äîhere‚Äôs how you can steal it for free.\"Relatable Pain Points: Address specific frustrations traders experience.Example:\"Ever felt like you're always too early or late to spot reversals? Here's how to get it right.\"Results-Oriented Prompts: Focus on delivering results or specific outcomes.Example:\"Want to double your win rate in under 60 seconds? Watch this.\"Hook Templates (to ensure variety and creativity):\"This is how to (industry tip/hack) in under 60 seconds.\"\"If you‚Äôre stuck with (industry pain point) and want (dream result), stop making this mistake.\"\"Here‚Äôs a strategy that helped me go from X to X in just X days.\"\"Stop getting caught in false breakouts‚Äîthis hack will change your trading forever.\"\"Want to learn how to spot trend reversals before everyone else? Watch this.\"\"Most traders fall for this common mistake‚Äîhere‚Äôs how to avoid it.\"\"I studied the top 10 traders of the past decade‚Äîhere‚Äôs what they all had in common.\"Key Notes for Hooks:Avoid revealing the indicator name in the hook: The goal is to build curiosity and keep viewers engaged until the payoff.Frame a problem or myth: Start by highlighting a frustration or misconception traders can relate to.Promise an exciting solution: End the hook by suggesting that a unique strategy or indicator will solve the problem.Use emotional triggers: Focus on emotions like FOMO, frustration, excitement, or curiosity to hook viewers in.Keep it short and punchy: Each hook should be brief, clear, and impactful‚Äîaim for no more than 1-2 sentences.[Body]Explain how the indicator works, breaking down its key features in a step-by-step manner.Introduce the core functionality first, then move on to more advanced features or use cases.Use simple, concise language to keep the viewer engaged.Provide detailed visual guidance to editors, specifying when and how different chart elements should appear.Example:[Body]‚ÄúThis indicator uses precise calculations to smooth out market noise and identify critical levels.‚Äù{The image shows a Bitcoin chart with key support and resistance zones highlighted by shaded green and red areas. Arrows mark the points where the price reacts to these levels, showing potential reversal zones.}[Animate the zones appearing one by one, then zoom in on the areas where the price reacts to the zones.][Payoff]Reveal the indicator‚Äôs name and provide a call to action, such as searching for the indicator on TradingView.End on a positive note, emphasizing the indicator‚Äôs benefits or popularity.Example:[Payoff]‚ÄúYou can find this indicator on TradingView by searching ‚ÄòDynamic Supply and Demand Zones by AlgoAlpha.‚Äô‚Äù{The final image shows the TradingView interface with the indicator panel displayed, including engagement metrics like likes and comments.}[Animate the search bar being used to find the indicator, then show the indicator panel appearing with the engagement metrics visible.]Output Requirements:Use the specified format strictly:[Hook, Body, or Payoff]NarrationImage Description in {} (static description of visuals)Visual & Animation Directions in [] (explicit instructions for animations and transitions)Detailed Visual Guidance:Ensure all key points in the narration have corresponding visual or animation instructions in [].Use specific terms like ‚Äúzoom,‚Äù ‚Äúpan,‚Äù ‚Äúhighlight,‚Äù or ‚Äúanimate‚Äù to describe how editors should present elements on screen.Hook Focus:The hook must be bold, engaging, and curiosity-driven. Use FOMO-based or problem-solving prompts to capture attention.Ensure the hook frames a relatable problem or pain point for traders.Clarity & Engagement:Keep sentences short and clear to maintain viewer attention.Use smooth transitions between different parts of the explanation to sustain engagement.Never Reveal the Indicator Name Early:The indicator‚Äôs name should only be revealed in the Payoff section to keep viewers watching until the end.Key Notes:Consistent Format: Always follow the specified format with {} for image descriptions and [] for animation directions.Focus on FOMO & Solutions: Hooks should create urgency and present a solution to a common trading problem."}, {"role": "user", "content": "//@version=5indicator(\"Dynamic Supply and Demand Zones [AlgoAlpha]\", \"AlgoAlpha - üì¶Dynamic Supply/Demand\",overlay = true, max_boxes_count = 500, max_bars_back = 4999)import PineCoders/VisibleChart/4dynamic = input.bool(true, \"Use Dynamic Look-Back\", \"If true, the indicator adjusts its lookback such that it considers data from the previous major pivot point to present\", group = \"Main Calculation\")len = input.int(100, \"Look-back (For Non-Dynamic Look-Back)\", group = \"Main Calculation\", tooltip = \"If Dynamic Look-Back is disabled, the indicator will use this fixed look-back instead\")plen = input.int(200, \"Pivot Point Detection Period\", tooltip = \"The look-back period of pivot points detection, pivots are detected with delay(depending on user imput, 100 by default)\", group = \"Main Calculation\")res = input.int(40, \"Resolution\", group = \"Main Calculation\", tooltip = \"The profile resolution\")scale = input.int(33, \"Profile Horizontal Width\", tooltip = \"The Horizontal Width of the profile, a smaller value will make the profile thinner\", maxval = 100, minval = 1, group = \"Main Calculation\")tolerance = input.float(0.93,\"Zone Tolerance\",tooltip = \"The tolerance for zone detection, the lower the value the less zones will be marked\", maxval = 1, minval = 0.01, group = \"Main Calculation\")h = input.bool(true, \"Show Profile\", group = \"Appearance\")h1 = input.bool(true, \"Show Background Box\", group = \"Appearance\")neut = input.color(color.gray, \"Levels Color\", group = \"Appearance\")green = input.color(#00ffbb, \"Bullish Color\", group = \"Appearance\")red = input.color(#ff1100, \"Bearish Color\", group = \"Appearance\")ph = ta.pivothigh(plen, plen)pl = ta.pivotlow(plen, plen)var pivotindex = 0if not na(ph) or not na(pl)    pivotindex := bar_index - plenlen1 = dynamic ? bar_index - pivotindex : lenvar left = 0top_boundaries = array.new_float(res)bottom_boundaries = array.new_float(res)binlen = array.new_float(res)var boxes = array.new_box()highs = array.new_float()lows = array.new_float()volumes = array.new_float()for i = 0 to bar_index - (bar_index - len1)    highs.push(high[i])    lows.push(low[i])    volumes.push(volume[i])maxx = array.max(highs)minn = array.min(lows)size = array.size(highs)var t = array.new_box()var lab = array.new_label()while t.size() > 0    t.shift().delete()while boxes.size() > 0    boxes.shift().delete()while lab.size() > 0    lab.shift().delete()if size > 0    step = (maxx - minn) / res    granularity = res    for i = 0 to granularity - 1        bin_size = 0.0        bottom = minn + (i*step)        top = minn + ( (i+1)*step )        bottom_boundaries.insert(i, bottom)        top_boundaries.insert(i, top)           for j = 0 to array.size(highs) - 1            candle_above_hbar = lows.get(j) > top            candle_below_hbar = highs.get(j) < bottom            is_candle_in_bucket = not (candle_above_hbar or candle_below_hbar)            bin_size += is_candle_in_bucket ? volumes.get(j) : 0        array.insert(binlen, i, bin_size)for i = 0 to res - 1    iskey = (i == res - 1 ? true : binlen.get(i) < binlen.get(i + 1)*tolerance) and (i == 0 ? true : binlen.get(i) < binlen.get(i - 1)*tolerance)    box_right = bar_index// + 7 + scale    box_left = iskey ?

These zones are based on significant price action areas, helping traders easily identify reversal zones. The second image highlights specific areas where price interacted with the reversal zones.
